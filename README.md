# Software Development Plan 
### High Level Description
Symbol-holic is a lightweight, very simple and specific program to train-muscle memory when typing symbols on the keyboard. It has two typing game modes, one which provides a random selection of all symbols on the keyboard, and the second game which takes the users 8 worst scored symbols and displays them multiple times to train them specifically.
### Target Problem
There are a lot of typing games on the market which focus on the alphabet characters on the key-board, but there is a need for an typing game which focusses solely on symbols, welcome Symbol-holic. When I starting programming, I found that I was making lots of errors trying to type symbols, so I needed a way to do targeted practice and see statistics on each key, rather than practicing on the fly and measuring performance on anecdotal evidence.

### Target Audience 
The target audience for this program is anyone that is struggling with accuracy and speed when typing symbols. Through some hard work and effort, the users of this program should see drastic changes in their symbol metrics. 
 
### How Target Audience will use it 
The target audience will download and install the program, which is a ruby gem. From there the user can run the program from the console, with 1 optional argument of the following: (-h or --help) for a help screen, (-d or --display) to display their typing statistics, (-r or --run) to run the standard typing game or (-t or --targeted) to run the targeted typing game.
